# Data folder

Keep pilot specific data into `pilots/` folder. This data should not be added to the repository.

For experiments and testing use experimental artificial labelled datasets in corresponding files in the main directory.

## CSV files

CSV files should contain the following field:

* `timestamp` - defining timestamp
* `label` - `True` or `False` defining if a field is an anomaly or not - field is optional for evaluation datasets
* `labelInfo` - custom field defining extend of the anomaly for labelled dataset

Any other fields will be interpreted as columns of a feature vector.

## Test datasets
